# Clyde
A basic AUR helper written in less than 200 lines of bash code

## Why?
Most AUR helpers attempt to act like pacman in many ways, which some people don't really like (like myself). At the same time, many AUR helpers are also very complex, making editing them a nightmare.

Clyde attempts to fix this by acting as a simple bash script that can easily be extended but also act completely different from pacman to reinforce the fact that the AUR is a different set of repos.

## How to install
Just add the bash script to your path, it's that easy

## How to use
* `install`/`ins` : Install a package
* `yeet`/`remove`/`rm`: Remove a package
* `upgrade`/`upg`: Upgrade either all AUR packages or just the specified one
* `help`: help

So simple, I know
